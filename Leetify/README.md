# Pyperclip
Pyperclip is a cross-platform Python module for copy and paste clipboard functions. It works with both Python 2 and 3. This module was created to enable cross-platform copy-pasting in Python which was earlier absent. The pyperclip module has copy() and paste() functions that can send text to and receive text from your computerâ€™s clipboard. Sending the output of your program to the clipboard will make it easy to paste it on an email, word processor, or some other software
